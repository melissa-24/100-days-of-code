### Day 4: May 4th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started basic outline of Help guide.  Chose to use less instead of just plain css so I could better manage page styling.

**Thoughts**: Made some good progress.  Got home page and 1 guide page set up - can copy the guide page sections for other pages.  Am pleased with it so far.

### Day 5: May 5th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Not much progress today worked on trying to get the individual data cards to render

**Thoughts**: Frustrated.  Can't get the individual cards to render.  It shows in the address bar but console.log doesn't show the right jsx document is rendering.  It shows it is going back to home.
