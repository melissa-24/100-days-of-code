### Day 5: May 5th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Not much progress today worked on trying to get the individual data cards to render

**Thoughts**: Frustrated.  Can't get the individual cards to render.  It shows in the address bar but console.log doesn't show the right jsx document is rendering.  It shows it is going back to home.

### Day 6: May 6th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Lots of progress finally got it working.

**Thoughts**: Got it to render so happy about that.  However each page is showing placeholders for the data that isn't that pages.  So need to find a way to use filter or hide for unused data on each page.
